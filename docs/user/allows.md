[TOC]

# Understanding permissions

There is a hierarchical classification of users based (from top to down):

1. ROLES
2. CATEGORIES
3. GROUPS
4. USERS

That classification will set the access to IsardVDI web application (roles) and also their [quota](quotas.md) (categories, groups and users). It will also set where the user resources will be stored in server:

â€‹	`...<role>/<category>/<group>/<username>/...`

## Roles

The role defines mainly where those users will have access within the IsardVDI web application:

| ROLES          | USER ACCESS   | ADMIN ACCESS |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Administrators | FULL          | FULL         |
| Advanced Users | FULL          | NONE         |
| Users          | Desktops only | NONE         |

## Categories ad Groups

These are only classification of users that will set them their [quotas](quotas.md). By default there is the **Local** category and group where all the new created users will be

## Users

Of course there is the user. Different [quotas](quotas.md) can be set up for each user if needed.

# Allows Form

Users are allowed to share templates and media with others with this form. By default no access will be given to anyone (nothing is checked).

- **NO ONE ALLOWED** (Default): Nothing is checked. That means that no role, category, group and user should be matched.
- **EVERYONE ALLOWED**: If you check (and activate) any role, category, group or user check box but you don't add any in the search box beside, it will match with ANY existing.
- **SOME ALLOWED**: To allow only for a certain role, category, group o user, just check it's check box and search for it in the search box beside. Note that if you leave the search box empty everyone will get access to that template or media.
